# Coronavirus_Visual_Analytics

A visual analytic system for analyzing big data related to Conornavirus COVID-19 outbreak. The system aims to provide visual insights of big data for clinical researchers.

This site is implemented and maintained by Rongchen Guo.

The system consists of three parts:

> 1) Analytic of virus outbreak severity in the world.

> 2) Analytic of international airlines distributions.

> 3) Analytic of economic recovery over time in terms of work resumption & labor absence.

## Outbreak Severity

Cumulative incidence within last 14 days of certain region is used as its severity.

> **"World Outbreak Severity"** displays the outbreak severity in world countries;

> **"Outbreak Severity of Europe"** displays the outbreak severity in European countries;

> **"Outbreak Severity of China"** displays the outbreak severity in Chinese provinces. 'cumulative confirmed cases' is used as the outbreak severity, instead of cumulative incidence.

> **"Predicted & Actual Cumulative Confirmed Cases"** displays the country/ province's predicted and actual cumulative confirmed cases across time. This view will change accordingly when users click on a certain country/ province in the map.

> **"Predicted Remaining Confirmed Cases"** displays the country/ province's predicted remaining confirmed cases across time. Remaining Confirmed Cases are cases to be confirmed in the future, so you can see a decreasing trend.This view will change accordingly when users click on a certain country/ province in the map.
            
## Airline Distributions

This is a statistical analysis of all airlines with PEK as destination during COVID-19 outbreaks (Mar 16th ~ Mar 21st). Direct flight and connecting flights are separately visualized.

> **"Overviews of Airlines to Beijing, China"** displays the proportion among direct flights and connecting flights.

> **"Airlines to Beijing (Direct Flight)"** displays all direct flights to PEK.

> **"Airlines to Beijing (One Transfer)"** displays all airlines to Beijing via one transfer.

> **"Airlines to Beijing (Two Transfers)"** displays all airlines to Beijing via two transfers.

## Economic Recovery

This is a visual analytic of economic recovery as the situation turns better in China. Specifically, the economy recovery is measured based on: (1) **work resumption rate** and (2) **labor absence proportion**.

> **"China Labor Resumption Rate"** displays the work resumption rate over time on a provincial basis.

> **"China Labor Absence Rate"** displays the labor absence proportion over time on a provincial basis.

> **"Population Inflow Ranking"** and **"Population Outflow Ranking"** lists cities with top population inflows and outflows.

> **"GDP-Weighted National Work Resumption Index"** displays the nation's overall work resumption rate across time under province GDP-weighted average.

> **"GDP-Weighted National Labor Shortage Index"** displays the nation's overall labor absence proportion across time under province GDP-weighted average.
